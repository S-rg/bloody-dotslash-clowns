## Description
When you have a lot of stuff laying around you're too lazy to figure out how it would fit into your shelves. Space Clowns is here to help you out.

**Fitting components into space contraint locations**
such as,
1. Packing suitcases 
2. Hostel rooms 
3. Desk Organization
4. Other space optimization problems

## Usage:
Simply take a picture of your items and the space you want to fit them into. Our app will automatically detect the items and the space and provide you with the best possible arrangement.

We use only the camera of your phone to detect the dimensions of objects so you do need a reference object to measure the dimensions of the other objects. This makes the app more accesisble avoiding sensors like LIDAR.

You can also add multiple shelves.
